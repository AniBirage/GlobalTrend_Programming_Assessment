# Global Trend Programming Profile Assessment

Welcome to the Global Trend Programming Profile assessment. This document outlines the requirements and guidelines for completing the programming assessment.

## Assessment Overview

This assessment consists of 10 programming questions designed to evaluate your problem-solving and coding skills in Python. You are required to attempt all the questions within a 1-day time period. The assessment is timed, and your submissions will be evaluated based on correctness, efficiency, and coding best practices.

## Instructions

- **Time Limit:** You have 24 hours to complete all 10 questions from the moment you start the assessment.
- **Programming Language:** All solutions must be written in Python.
- **Submission:**
  - **Word Document:** Create a Word document containing your code for each question along with screenshots of the output. Name the file `Programming_Assessment_YourName.docx`.
  - **GitHub Profile:** Create a GitHub profile if you don't already have one. Upload all your code files to a new repository named `GlobalTrend_Programming_Assessment`.

## Questions

1. **MaxHeap Class:**
   - Implement a Python class `MaxHeap` that supports the following operations: `insert`, `delete`, and `get_max`. Ensure the operations maintain the properties of a max-heap.

2. **Download with Retry:**
   - Write a Python function that takes a list of URLs, attempts to download their content, and retries up to 3 times if an error occurs. Use appropriate error handling to manage different types of exceptions.

3. **Linear Regression Model:**
   - Write a Python script that trains a simple linear regression model using scikit-learn. Use a dataset of your choice, split it into training and testing sets, and evaluate the model's performance.

4. **DataFrame Preprocessing:**
   - Using pandas, write a Python function to clean and preprocess a given DataFrame, which involves handling missing values, normalizing numerical columns, and encoding categorical columns.

5. **Fibonacci Number:**
   - Write a Python function to compute the nth Fibonacci number using recursion.

6. **Division with Error Handling:**
   - Write a Python function that divides two numbers and handles the case where the divisor is zero by returning a custom error message.

7. **Execution Time Decorator:**
   - Write a Python decorator that measures the execution time of a function and logs it. Apply this decorator to a function that performs a computationally expensive task.

8. **Arithmetic Operation:**
   - Write a Python function that takes two numbers and an operator (as a string) and performs the corresponding arithmetic operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division).

9. **Random Password Generator:**
   - Write a Python function that generates a random password. The password should contain a mix of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, digits, and special characters.

10. **Matrix Transpose:**
    - Write a Python function that takes a 2D list (matrix) and returns its transpose.
